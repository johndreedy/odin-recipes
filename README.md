# Odin Recipes
### Website available here: https://johndreedy.github.io/the-odin-project/odin-recipes/index.html

Odin Recipes is a food recipe website, through which I am demonstrating my abilities in HTML including boilerplate metadata, head and body tags, titles (h1 - h6), hyperlinks, images and more. It also contains basic CSS formatting to make the website more appealing. The pages are as follows:

* An index page with links to other pages
* A chorizo and potato recipe
* A pasta puttanesca recipe
* A Swedish sticky chocolate cake recipe

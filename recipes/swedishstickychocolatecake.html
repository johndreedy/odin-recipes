    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Swedish sticky chocolate cake, also known as Kladdkaka, is a devilishly more-ish desert straight from the Nordic country itself.</p>
    <p>It is best served warm, similar to a brownie, with strawberries and ice cream.</p>
    <p>Especially recommended is Swedish glace ice cream which compliments the cake well with its extra creamy flavour.</p>

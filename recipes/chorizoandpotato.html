<h2>Description</h2>
</body>
<p>Chorizo and potato is a tasty Spanish main course served with onions and garlic in a sherry sauce.</p>
<p>It uses new potatos cut down the middle which absorb the juices from the chorizo, lending to the overall flavour.</p>
<p>Other spices can be added to enhance the dish, and the amount of water added varies based on how strong you would like the sauce to be.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>A chorizo sausage</li>
    <li>500g of potatos</li>
    <li>A large onion</li>
    <li>A clove of garlic</li>
    <li>250ml of sherry</li>
    <li>Two bay leaves</li>
    <li>A dash of olive oil</li>
    <li>Water</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>With a large stock pot on the hob at low heat, add a dash of olive oil.</li>
    <li>Peel and finely chop the onion, and add it to the pot.</li>
    <li>Use a garlic press to crush the garlic and add all of it to the pot.</li>
    <li>Wash the new potatos thoroughly in a sive, and chop each of them in two before adding them.</li>
    <li>Chop the chorizo into smaller pieces and add it to the mix.</li>
    <li>Now add the 250ml of sherry. 
    <li>If the sherry doesn't quite cover what's inside the pot, add a little extra water to dilute the sauce.</li>
    <li>Add two bay leaves.</li>
    <li>Wait until the sauce starts to boil, then put the lid on the pot and leave for 10 minutes while the oven pre-heats.</li>
    <li>Once it has cooked on the hob for 10 mins, put it in the oven with the lid off and cook for 35 mins.</li>
    <li>Take the pot out of the oven, serve and enjoy!</li>
